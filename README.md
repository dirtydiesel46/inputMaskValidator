# inputMaskValidator
A recreation of the Progenitor Softworks Qt series  -> Qt Tutorial: Unit 15, QLineEdit, Input-Masks and Validators

I have "recreated" this as I realized the website that should hold the source code, is unavailable - I did look around on Github and searched everywhere, even mailed the creator but no availabel source code was found and I haven't yet received a response on my mail - so I decided lets redo it by looking at the tutorial lesson that can be found here:

Be aware, the SignalIndicator class is explained here:
